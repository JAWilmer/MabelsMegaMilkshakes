## Mega Milkshakes

Mega Milkshakes is a full-stack web application that allows users to manipulate data on a dynamic restaurant menu. Users may add, delete, or move milkshakes between the current and past milkshake menus. Applying the MCV design pattern to query and route data, Mega Milkshakes uses MySQL, Node, Express, and Handlebars and a homemade ORM. Mega Milkshakes Data is called, stored, or deleted from a MySQL database. HTML templating is assisted with Handlebars.
